OrangeMelt
==========

A simple HTML5 collaboration game I made a while back and thought I would share, for people curious.

The live version of it is here: http://jaxbot.me/orangemelt

OrangeMelt is a simple real-time edited world, where anyone can evolve or devolve the OrangeMelt world from their browser.

Over the last year, the world has continued to change, despite me doing little to no advertising for it. Interesting.
